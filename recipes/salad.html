        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>There are basically two types of salads that are popularly eaten in Nigeria, Salads happens to be one of the healthiest set of foods that I know, especially the vegetable salad, I also like the fruit salad.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Medium size cabbage</li>
            <li>4 medium size carrot</li>
            <li>lettuce leaves</li>
            <li>2 cups of chopped green beans</li>
            <li>half cup peas (optional)</li>
            <li>3 cooked eggs</li>
            <li>one can of baked beans</li>
            <li>2 big size of cucumber</li>
            <li>salad cream (heinz, BAMA mayonnaise)</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Chop the carrot /green beans/cucumber and set aside in different bowls, I like to peel off the greenback of cucumbers and also remove the center seeds,</li>
            <li>Slice the cabbage too in a different tray (we use tray often in our home), slice the lettuce leaves, boil the eggs and remove the shell (3 eggs).</li>
            <li>You then need to soften the green beans, carrot, and peas, most of the time we heat carrot, green beans, and peas together and soak the cabbage in warm water for a minute.</li>
            <li>Soaking the cabbage in warm water was a trick to soften the cabbage, these days, I donâ€™t use warm water. I just wash with cold water, slice and mix with the rest of the vegetables. Voila.</li>
        </ol>
